üî¨ Investigation & Findings
1Ô∏è‚É£ Tracking Bryce's File Access
Initial analysis of DeviceFileEvents revealed Bryce accessed critical corporate documents such as:
Q1-2025-ResearchAndDevelopment.pdf
Q2-2025-HumanTrials.pdf
Q3-2025-AnimalTrials-SiberianTigers.pdf
Hash (b3302e58be7eb604fda65d1d04a5e18325c66792) confirmed file integrity across different devices.

| order by TimeGenerated desc 
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, FileName, SHA1
2Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying Other Workstations Used
The DeviceFileEvents table was queried for instances of the same file hashes appearing on multiple workstations.
lobby-fl2-ae5fc was flagged, confirming Bryce accessed corporate files on a guest workstation.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Detecting Steganography Usage
DeviceProcessEvents logs revealed Bryce used steghide.exe on lobby-fl2-ae5fc to embed corporate PDFs into personal images.
Affected images:
suzie-and-bob.bmp
bryce-and-kid.bmp
bryce-fishing.bmp

| where ProcessCommandLine contains "steghide.exe"
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, AccountName, ProcessCommandLine
‚úÖ Resulting File Path: C:\ProgramData\bryce-fishing.bmp

4Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying Compression & Exfiltration Attempts
Logs confirmed 7z.exe was used to compress the stego images into a zip file (marketing_misc.zip).
The final destination of the zip file was F:\ on the lobby workstation, indicating an attempt to move the data outside company systems.

| order by TimeGenerated desc
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, FileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, FolderPath, SHA256
‚úÖ Compressed File Location: F:\marketing_misc.zip

5Ô∏è‚É£ Linking Bryce Directly to the Exfiltration
The final piece of evidence tied Bryce directly to the exfiltration:
The SHA256 hash (707f415d7d581edd9bce99a0429ad4629d3be0316c329e8b9ebd576f7ab50b71) confirmed that a process linked to Bryce interacted with the stolen data.
A critical log at 2025-02-05T08:57:32.2582822Z showed marketing_misc.zip being moved into Bryce‚Äôs personal folder before potential exfiltration.
